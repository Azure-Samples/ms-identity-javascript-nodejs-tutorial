## Overview

This sample demonstrates a Node.js Express Web App application that authenticates users against Azure AD B2C.

## Scenario

1. The client Node.js Express Web App application uses the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to obtain an ID Token from **Azure AD B2C**:
2. The **ID Token** proves that the user has successfully authenticated against **Azure AD B2C**.

## Prerequisites

- An **Azure AD B2C** tenant. For more information see: [How to get an Azure AD B2C tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-tenant)
- A user account in your **Azure AD B2C**.

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-nodejs-tutorial.git
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> :warning: Given that the name of the sample is quite long, and so are the names of the referenced packages, you might want to clone it in a folder close to the root of your hard drive, to avoid maximum file path length limitations on Windows.

### Register the sample application(s) with your Azure Active Directory tenant

:warning: This sample comes with a pre-registered application for testing purposes. If you would like to use your own **Azure AD B2C** tenant and application, follow the steps below to register and configure the application in the **Azure Portal**. Otherwise, continue with the steps for [Running the sample](#running-the-sample).

### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD B2C tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD B2C tenant.

### Create User Flows and Custom Policies

Please refer to: [Tutorial: Create user flows in Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-user-flows)

### Add External Identity Providers

Please refer to: [Tutorial: Add identity providers to your applications in Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-add-identity-providers)

### Register the webApp app (WebAppB2C)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD B2C** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `WebAppB2C`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox, Outlook.com)**.
   - In the **Redirect URI (optional)** section, select **Web** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URI: `https://localhost:4000/redirect`.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, click on the **Certificates & secrets** blade in the left to open the page where we can generate secrets and upload certificates.
1. In the **Client secrets** section, click on **New client secret**:
   - Type a key description (for instance `app secret`),
   - Select one of the available key durations (**In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**) as per your security posture.
   - The generated key value will be displayed when you click the **Add** button. Copy the generated value for use in the steps later.
   - You'll need this key later in your code's configuration files. This key value will not be displayed again, and is not retrievable by any other means, so make sure to note it from the Azure portal before navigating to any other screen or blade.

#### Configure the webApp app (WebAppB2C) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `auth.json` file.
1. Find the key `ClientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `WebAppB2C` application copied from the Azure portal.

<!-- ENTER CONFIGURATION STEPS FOR B2C USER-FLOWS/CUSTOM POLICIES BELOW -->

1. Find the key `TenantId` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.

<!-- ENTER CONFIGURATION STEPS FOR B2C USER-FLOWS/CUSTOM POLICIES BELOW -->

1. Find the key `ClientSecret` and replace the existing value with the key you saved during the creation of the `WebAppB2C` app, in the Azure portal.

## Deployment

### Deployment to Azure App Serives

There is one web project in this sample. To deploy it to **Azure App Services**, you'll need to:

- create an **Azure App Service**
- publish the projects to the **App Services**, and
- update its client(s) to call the web site instead of the local environment.

#### Create and publish `WebAppB2C` to an Azure App Services

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Click `Create a resource` in the top left-hand corner, select **Web** --> **Web App**, and give your web site a name, for example, `WebAppB2C-contoso.azurewebsites.net`.
1. Next, select the `Subscription`, `Resource Group`, `App service plan and Location`. `OS` will be **Windows** and `Publish` will be **Code**.
1. Click `Create` and wait for the App Service to be created.
1. Once you get the `Deployment succeeded` notification, then click on `Go to resource` to navigate to the newly created App service.

<!-- Review and delete the following lines if not applicable -->
1. The following steps provide instructions to create a Sql database that the sample needs. If you already have a Sql Server and database present and a connection string available, skip the steps till we ask you to provide the connections string in the `Application Settings`.
1. Click `Create a resource` in the top left-hand corner again, select **Databases** --> **SQL Database**, to create a new database. Follow the `Quickstart tutorial` if needed.
1. You can name the Sql server and database whatever you want to.
1. Select or create a database server, and enter server login credentials. Carefully note down the username and password for the Sql server as you'll need it when constructing your Sql conenction string later.
1. Wait for the `Deployment succeeded` notification, then click on `Go to resource` to navigate to the newly created database's manage screen.
1. Click on **Connection Strings** on left menu and copy the **ADO.NET (SQL authentication)** connection string. Populate  **User ID={your_username};Password={your_password};** with values your provided during database creation.Copy this connection string.
<!-- Review and delete the preceding lines if not applicable end -->

1. Once the web site is created, locate it it in the **Dashboard** and click it to open **App Services** **Overview** screen.

<!-- Review and delete the following lines if not applicable -->
1. Click on **Application settings** in the left menu of the App service and add the copied Sql connection string in the **Connection strings** section as `DefaultConnection`.
1. Choose `SQLAzure` in the **Type** dropdown. **Save** the setting.
<!-- Review and delete the preceding lines if not applicable end -->


##### Update the Azure AD B2C app registration for `WebAppB2C`

1. Navigate back to to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations (Preview)**.
1. In the resulting screen, select the `WebAppB2C` application.
1. From the *Branding* menu, update the **Home page URL**, to the address of your service, for example [https://WebAppB2C-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://WebAppB2C-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Save the configuration.
1. Add the same URL in the list of values of the *Authentication -> Redirect URIs* menu. If you have multiple redirect URIs, make sure that there a new entry using the App service's URI for each redirect URI.

> :warning: If your app is using an *in-memory* storage, **Azure App Services** will spin down your web site if it is inactive, and any records that your app was keeping will emptied. In addition, if you increase the instance count of your web site, requests will be distributed among the instances. Your app's records, therefore, will not be the same on each instance.
