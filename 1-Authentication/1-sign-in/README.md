## Overview

This sample demonstrates a Node.js & Express web application that authenticates users against Azure AD, with the help of [Microsoft Authentication Library for Node.js [PREVIEW]](https://aka.ms/msalnode) (MSAL Node [PREVIEW]). In doing so, it also illustrates various authentication concepts, such as [OpenID scopes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#openid-connect-scopes), [ID Tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens), [ID Token validation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens#validating-an-id_token) and more.

## Scenario

1. The client application uses **MSAL Node** to obtain an ID Token from **Azure AD**.
2. The **ID Token** proves that the user has successfully authenticated against **Azure AD**.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed to run this sample.
- A modern web browser. This sample uses **ES6** conventions and will not run on **Internet Explorer**.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is recommended for running and editing this sample.
- An **Azure AD** tenant. For more information, see: [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant)
- A user account in your **Azure AD** tenant. This sample will not work with a **personal Microsoft account**. Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a personal account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-nodejs-tutorial.git
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> :warning: To avoid path length limitations on Windows, we recommend cloning into a directory near the root of your drive.

### Step 2: Install project dependencies

Locate the root of the sample folder. Then:

```console
    cd 1-Authentication\1-sign-in
    npm install
```

## Registration

There is one project in this sample. To register it, you can:

- follow the steps below for manually register your apps
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  - modify the projects' configuration files.

<details>
  <summary>Expand this section if you want to use this automation:</summary>

> :warning: If you have never used **Azure AD Powershell** before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.

1. On Windows, run PowerShell as **Administrator** and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. If you have never used Azure AD Powershell before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   cd .\AppCreationScripts\
   .\Configure.ps1
   ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)
   > The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.

</details>

### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

### Register the app

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `ms-identity-nodejs-webapp`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
   - In the **Redirect URI (optional)** section, select **Web** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URI: `http://localhost:4000/redirect`.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Certificates & secrets** blade in the left to open the page where we can generate secrets and upload certificates.
1. In the **Client secrets** section, select **New client secret**:
   - Type a key description (for instance `app secret`),
   - Select one of the available key durations (**In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**) as per your security posture.
   - The generated key value will be displayed when you select the **Add** button. Copy the generated value for use in the steps later.
   - You'll need this key later in your code's configuration files. This key value will not be displayed again, and is not retrievable by any other means, so make sure to note it from the Azure portal before navigating to any other screen or blade.

#### Configure the app to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `auth.json` file.
1. Find the key `ClientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the application copied from the **Azure Portal**.
1. Find the key `TenantId` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID copied from the **Azure Portal**.
1. Find the key `ClientSecret` and replace the existing value with the key you saved during the creation of the application copied from the **Azure Portal**.
1. Find the key `homePageRoute` and replace the existing value with the home page route of your application, e.g. `/home`.
1. Find the key `redirectUri` and replace the existing value with the redirect URI that you have registered on **Azure Portal**, e.g. `http://localhost:4000/redirect`.
1. Find the key `postLogoutRedirectUri` and replace the existing value with the URI of the page that you wish to be redirected after signing-out, e.g `http://localhost:4000/`.

## Running the sample

Locate the root of the sample folder. Then:

```console
    npm start
```

## Explore the sample

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000`.
1. Click the sign-in button on the top right corner.
