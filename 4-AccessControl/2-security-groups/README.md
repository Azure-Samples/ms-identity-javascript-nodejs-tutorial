## Overview

This sample demonstrates a Node.js & Express web app that is secured with the [Microsoft Authentication Library for Node.js](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-node) (MSAL Node). The app implements **Role-based Access Control** (RBAC) by using Azure AD [Security Groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/community/all-about-groups). In the sample, users in **TaskUser** role can perform CRUD operations on their todo list, while users in **TaskAdmin** role can see all other users' tasks.

Access control in Azure AD can be done with **App Roles** as well, as we covered in the [previous tutorial](../1-app-roles/README.md). **Security Groups** and **App Roles** in Azure AD are by no means mutually exclusive - they can be used in tandem to provide even finer grained access control.

## Scenario

1. The client application uses **MSAL Node** (via [msal-node-wrapper](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-nodejs-tutorial/tree/main/Common/msal-node-wrapper)) to sign-in a user and obtain an **ID Token** from **Azure AD**.
2. The **ID Token** contains the [groups claim](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-fed-group-claims) that is used to control access to protected routes.

- A user account in your **Azure AD** tenant.

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-nodejs-tutorial.git
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> :warning: To avoid path length limitations on Windows, we recommend cloning into a directory near the root of your drive.

### Step 2: Install project dependencies

```console
    cd 4-AccessControl/2-security-groups/App
    npm install
```

### Registration

There is one project in this sample. To register it, you can:

- follow the steps below for manually register your apps
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  - modify the projects' configuration files.

<details>
   <summary>Expand this section if you want to use this automation:</summary>

> :warning: If you have never used **Microsoft Graph PowerShell** before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts Guide](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.

1. Ensure that you have [PowerShell 7](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.3) or later.
1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. For interactive process -in PowerShell, run:

    ```PowerShell
    cd .\AppCreationScripts\
    .\Configure.ps1 -TenantId "[Optional] - your tenant id" -AzureEnvironmentName "[Optional] - Azure environment, defaults to 'Global'"
    ```

> Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts guide](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md). The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.

> :information_source: This sample can make use of client certificates. You can use **AppCreationScripts** to register an Azure AD application with certificates. See: [How to use certificates instead of client secrets](./README-use-certificate.md)

</details>

### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

### Register the client app (msal-node-webapp)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `msal-node-webapp`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
   - In the **Redirect URI (optional)** section, select **Web** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URI: `http://localhost:4000/redirect`.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Certificates & secrets** blade in the left to open the page where you can generate secrets and upload certificates.
1. In the **Client secrets** section, select **New client secret**:
   - Type a key description (for instance `app secret`),
   - Select one of the available key durations (**6 months**, **12 months** or **Custom**) as per your security posture.
   - The generated key value will be displayed when you select the **Add** button. Copy and save the generated value for use in later steps.
   - You'll need this key later in your code's configuration files. This key value will not be displayed again, and is not retrievable by any other means, so make sure to note it from the Azure portal before navigating to any other screen or blade.
    > :warning: For enhanced security, consider using **certificates** instead of client secrets. See: [How to use certificates instead of secrets](./README-use-certificate.md).
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
   - Select the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected.
   - In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, select **Microsoft Graph**
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **User.Read**, **GroupMember.Read.All** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.
   - Finally, grant **admin consent** for these scopes (required to handle the [overage scenario](#the-groups-overage-claim))

#### Configure Optional Claims

1. Still on the same app registration, select the **Token configuration** blade to the left.
1. Select **Add optional claim**:
    1. Select **optional claim type**, then choose **Access**.
    1. Select the optional claim **acct**.
    > Provides user's account status in tenant. If the user is a **member** of the tenant, the value is *0*. If they're a **guest**, the value is *1*.
    1. Select **Add** to save your changes.

#### Configure the client app (msal-node-webapp) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `App/authConfig.js` file.
1. Find the key `clientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `msal-node-webapp` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `tenantId` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.
1. Find the key `clientSecret` and replace the existing value with the key you saved during the creation of `msal-node-webapp` copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `redirectUri` and replace the existing value with the Redirect URI for `msal-node-webapp`. (by default `http://localhost:4000/redirect`).

> :information_source: For `redirectUri`, you can simply enter the path component of the URI instead of the full URI. For example, instead of `http://localhost:4000/redirect`, you can simply enter `/redirect`. This may come in handy in deployment scenarios.

1. Open the `App/app.js` file.
1. Find the string `ENTER_YOUR_SECRET_HERE` and replace it with a secret that will be used when encrypting your app's session using the [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) package.

### Create Security Groups

> :warning: You may already have security groups with the names defined below in your tenant and/or you may not have permissions to create new security groups. In that case, skip the steps below and update the configuration files in your project(s) with the desired names/IDs of existing groups in your tenant.

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Select **Groups** blade on the left.
1. In the **Groups** blade, select **New Group**.
    1. For **Group Type**, select **Security**
    1. For **Group Name**, enter **GroupAdmin**
    1. For **Group Description**, enter **Admin Security Group**
    1. Add **Group Owners** and **Group Members** as you see fit.
    1. Select **Create**.
1. In the **Groups** blade, select **New Group**.
    1. For **Group Type**, select **Security**
    1. For **Group Name**, enter **GroupMember**
    1. For **Group Description**, enter **User Security Group**
    1. Add **Group Owners** and **Group Members** as you see fit.
    1. Select **Create**.
1. Assign the user accounts that you plan to work with to these security groups.

For more information, visit: [Create a basic group and add members using Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-groups-create-azure-portal)

### Configure Security Groups

You have two different options available to you on how you can further configure your application to receive the `groups` claim.

1. [Receive **all the groups** that the signed-in user is assigned to in an Azure AD tenant, included nested groups](#configure-your-application-to-receive-all-the-groups-the-signed-in-user-is-assigned-to-including-nested-groups).
2. [Receive the **groups** claim values from a **filtered set of groups** that your application is programmed to work with](#configure-your-application-to-receive-the-groups-claim-values-from-a-filtered-set-of-groups-a-user-may-be-assigned-to) (Not available in the [Azure AD Free edition](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/)).

> To get the on-premise group's `samAccountName` or `On Premises Group Security Identifier` instead of Group ID, please refer to the document [Configure group claims for applications with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-fed-group-claims#prerequisites-for-using-group-attributes-synchronized-from-active-directory).

#### Configure your application to receive **all the groups** the signed-in user is assigned to, including nested groups

1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Token Configuration** blade in the left to open the page where you can configure the claims provided tokens issued to your application.
1. Select the **Add groups claim** button on top to open the **Edit Groups Claim** screen.
1. Select `Security groups` **or** the `All groups (includes distribution lists but not groups assigned to the application)` option. Choosing both negates the effect of `Security Groups` option.
1. Under the **ID** section, select `Group ID`. This will result in Azure AD sending the [object id](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0) of the groups the user is assigned to in the **groups** claim of the [ID Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens) that your app receives after signing-in a user.

#### Configure your application to receive the `groups` claim values from a **filtered set of groups** a user may be assigned to

##### Prerequisites, benefits and limitations of using this option

1. This option is useful when your application is interested in a selected set of groups that a signing-in user may be assigned to and not every security group this user is assigned to in the tenant.  This option also saves your application from running into the [overage](#groups-overage-claim) issue.
1. This feature is not available in the [Azure AD Free edition](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/).
1. **Nested group assignments** are not available when this option is utilized.

##### Steps to enable this option in your app

1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Token Configuration** blade in the left to open the page where you can configure the claims provided tokens issued to your application.
1. Select the **Add groups claim** button on top to open the **Edit Groups Claim** screen.
1. Select `Groups assigned to the application`.
    1. Choosing additional options like `Security Groups` or `All groups (includes distribution lists but not groups assigned to the application)` will negate the benefits your app derives from choosing to use this option.
1. Under the **ID** section, select `Group ID`. This will result in Azure AD sending the object [id](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0) of the groups the user is assigned to in the `groups` claim of the [ID Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens) that your app receives after signing-in a user.
1. If you are exposing a Web API using the **Expose an API** option, then you can also choose the `Group ID` option under the **Access** section. This will result in Azure AD sending the [Object ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0) of the groups the user is assigned to in the `groups` claim of the [Access Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) issued to the client applications of your API.
1. In the app's registration screen, select on the **Overview** blade in the left to open the Application overview screen. Select the hyperlink with the name of your application in **Managed application in local directory** (note this field title can be truncated for instance `Managed application in ...`). When you select this link you will navigate to the **Enterprise Application Overview** page associated with the service principal for your application in the tenant where you created it. You can navigate back to the app registration page by using the *back* button of your browser.
1. Select the **Users and groups** blade in the left to open the page where you can assign users and groups to your application.
    1. Select the **Add user** button on the top row.
    1. Select **User and Groups** from the resultant screen.
    1. Choose the groups that you want to assign to this application.
    1. Click **Select** in the bottom to finish selecting the groups.
    1. Select **Assign** to finish the group assignment process.  
    1. Your application will now receive these selected groups in the `groups` claim when a user signing in to your app is a member of  one or more these **assigned** groups.
1. Select the **Properties** blade in the left to open the page that lists the basic properties of your application.Set the **User assignment required?** flag to **Yes**.

> :bulb: **Important security tip**
>
> When you set **User assignment required?** to **Yes**, Azure AD will check that only users assigned to your application in the **Users and groups** blade are able to sign-in to your app. You can assign users directly or by assigning security groups they belong to.

## Running the sample

```console
    cd 4-AccessControl/1-security-groups/App
    npm start
```

## Explore the sample

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000`.
1. Sign-in using the button on top-right.
1. Click on the **TodoList** button to access your (the signed-in user's) todo list.
1. If the signed-in user has the right privileges (i.e. in the right "role"), click on the **Dashboard** button to access every users' todo list.
1. If the signed-in user does not have the right privileges, clicking on the **Dashboard** will give an error.

### Implementing role-based access control

In [appSettings.js](./App/appSettings.js), we create an access matrix that defines the required roles and allowed HTTP methods for each route that we like to grant role-based access:

```js
{
    accessMatrix: {
        todolist: {
            methods: ["GET", "POST", "DELETE"],
            groups: ["Enter_the_ObjectId_of_GroupAdmin", "Enter_the_ObjectId_of_GroupMember"]
        },
        dashboard: {
            methods: ["GET"],
            groups: ["Enter_the_ObjectId_of_GroupAdmin"]
        }
    }
}
```

Then, in [app.js](./App/app.js), we create an instance of the [MsalWebAppAuthClient](https://azure-samples.github.io/microsoft-identity-express/classes/msalwebappauthclient.html) class.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const session = require('express-session');
const MsIdExpress = require('microsoft-identity-express');

const appSettings = require('./appSettings.js');
const mainRouter = require('./routes/mainRoutes');

const SERVER_PORT = process.env.PORT || 4000;

// initialize express
const app = express(); 

app.use(session({
    secret: 'ENTER_YOUR_SECRET_HERE',
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    cookie: {
        secure: false, // set this to true on production
    }
}));

app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(express.json());

// instantiate the wrapper
const msid = new MsIdExpress.WebAppAuthClientBuilder(appSettings).build();

// initialize the wrapper
app.use(msid.initialize());

// pass the instance to your routers
app.use(mainRouter(msid));

app.listen(SERVER_PORT, () => console.log(`Msal Node Auth Code Sample app listening on port ${SERVER_PORT}!`));

module.exports = app;
```

The `msid` object exposes the middleware we can use to protect our app routes. This can be seen in [mainRoutes.js](./App/routes/mainRoutes.js):

```javascript
const express = require('express');

module.exports = (msid) => {

    // initialize router
    const router = express.Router();

    // app routes
    router.get('/', (req, res, next) => res.redirect('/home'));
    router.get('/home', mainController.getHomePage);

    // authentication routes
    router.get('/signin', msid.signIn({ postLoginRedirect: '/' }));
    router.get('/signout', msid.signOut({ postLogoutRedirect: '/' }));

    // secure routes
    router.get('/id', msid.isAuthenticated(), mainController.getIdPage);

    router.use('/todolist',
        msid.isAuthenticated(),
        msid.hasAccess({
            accessRule: config.accessMatrix.todolist
        }),
        todolistRouter // users have to satisfy hasAccess middleware for all routes under /todolist
    );

    router.use('/dashboard',
        msid.isAuthenticated(),
        msid.hasAccess({
            accessRule: config.accessMatrix.dashboard
        }),
        dashboardRouter // users have to satisfy hasAccess middleware for all routes under /dashboard
    );

    return router;
}
```

Under the hood, the [hasAccess](https://azure-samples.github.io/microsoft-identity-express/classes/MsalWebAppAuthClient.html#hasAccess) middleware checks the signed-in user's ID token's `groups` claim to determine whether she has access to this route given the access matrix provided in [appSettings.js](./App/appSettings.js):

```typescript
    hasAccess(options: GuardOptions): RequestHandler {
        return async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction): Promise<void> => {
            if (!this.webAppSettings.accessMatrix) {
                this.logger.error(ConfigurationErrorMessages.NO_ACCESS_MATRIX_CONFIGURED);
                return next(new Error(ConfigurationErrorMessages.NO_ACCESS_MATRIX_CONFIGURED));
            }

            if (!req.session.account?.idTokenClaims) {
                this.logger.error(ErrorMessages.ID_TOKEN_CLAIMS_NOT_FOUND);
                return next(new Error(ErrorMessages.ID_TOKEN_CLAIMS_NOT_FOUND));
            }

            const checkFor = options.accessRule.hasOwnProperty(AccessControlConstants.GROUPS)
                ? AccessControlConstants.GROUPS
                : AccessControlConstants.ROLES;

            switch (checkFor) {
                case AccessControlConstants.GROUPS:
                    // ...
                    break;

                case AccessControlConstants.ROLES:
                    if (!req.session.account.idTokenClaims[AccessControlConstants.ROLES]) {
                        return res.redirect(this.webAppSettings.authRoutes.unauthorized);
                    } else {
                        const roles = req.session.account.idTokenClaims[AccessControlConstants.ROLES] as string[];

                        if (!this.checkAccessRule(req.method, options.accessRule, roles, AccessControlConstants.ROLES)) {
                            return res.redirect(this.webAppSettings.authRoutes.unauthorized);
                        }
                    }

                    next();
                    break;

                default:
                    break;
            }
        };
    };
```

### The groups overage claim

To ensure that the token size doesn’t exceed HTTP header size limits, the Microsoft Identity Platform limits the number of object Ids that it includes in the **groups** claim.

If a user is member of more groups than the overage limit (**150 for SAML tokens, 200 for JWT tokens, 6 for single-page applications**), then the Microsoft identity platform does not emit the group IDs in the `groups` claim in the token. Instead, it includes an **overage** claim in the token that indicates to the application to query the [MS Graph API](https://graph.microsoft.com) to retrieve the user’s group membership.

> We strongly advise you use the [group filtering feature](#configure-your-application-to-receive-the-groups-claim-values-from-a-filtered-set-of-groups-a-user-may-be-assigned-to) (if possible) to avoid running into group overages.

#### Create the overage scenario for testing

1. You can use the `BulkCreateGroups.ps1` provided in the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/) folder to create a large number of groups and assign users to them. This will help test overage scenarios during development. **Remember to change** the user's **objectId** provided in the `BulkCreateGroups.ps1` script.

When attending to overage scenarios, which requires a call to [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com) to read the signed-in user's group memberships, your app will need to have the [User.Read](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/permissions-reference#user-permissions) and [GroupMember.Read.All](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/permissions-reference#group-permissions) for the [getMemberGroups](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/user-getmembergroups) function to execute successfully.

> :warning: For the overage scenario, make sure you have granted **Admin Consent** for the MS Graph API's **GroupMember.Read.All** scope (see the **App Registration** steps above).

#### Handle the overage scenario

When the overage occurs, the user's ID token will have the `_claim_names` and `_claim_sources` claims instead of the `groups` claim. Furthermore, `_claim_sources` claim contains the URL that we can query to get the full list of groups the user belongs to. In the [hasAccess()](https://azure-samples.github.io/microsoft-identity-express/classes/MsalWebAppAuthClient.html#hasAccess) middleware we detect if the overage, and trigger the [handleOverage](https://azure-samples.github.io/microsoft-identity-express/classes/MsalWebAppAuthClient.html#handleOverage) method to query the URL we mentioned.

```typescript
    private async handleOverage(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction, rule: AccessRule): Promise<void> {
        if (!req.session.account?.idTokenClaims) {
            this.logger.error(ErrorMessages.ID_TOKEN_CLAIMS_NOT_FOUND);
            return next(new Error(ErrorMessages.ID_TOKEN_CLAIMS_NOT_FOUND));
        }

        const { _claim_names, _claim_sources, ...newIdTokenClaims } = req.session.account.idTokenClaims;

        const silentRequest: SilentFlowRequest = {
            account: req.session.account,
            scopes: AccessControlConstants.GRAPH_MEMBER_SCOPES.split(' '),
        };

        try {
            // acquire token silently to be used in resource call
            const tokenResponse = await this.msalClient.acquireTokenSilent(silentRequest);

            if (!tokenResponse) return res.redirect(this.webAppSettings.authRoutes.unauthorized);

            try {
