## Overview

This sample demonstrates a Node.js & Express web application that authenticates users against [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) (Azure AD) and obtains [access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) to call [Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/overview) (MS Graph) and [Azure Resource Manager API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview) (ARM API), with the help of [Microsoft Authentication Library for Node.js](https://aka.ms/msalnode) (MSAL Node).  In doing so, it illustrates authorization concepts such as [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow), [dynamic scopes and incremental consent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent), **working with multiple resources** and more.

This sample also demonstrates how to use the [Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-javascript) for working with the Microsoft Graph API.

## Scenario

1. The client application uses **MSAL Node** (via [msal-node-wrapper](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-nodejs-tutorial/tree/main/Common/msal-node-wrapper)) to sign-in a user and obtain a JWT **Access Token** from **Azure AD**.
1. The **Access Token** is used as a *bearer* token to authorize the user to access the **resource server** ([MS Graph](https://aka.ms/graph) or [Azure REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/azure/)).
1. The **resource server** responds with the resource that the user has access to.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed to run this sample.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is recommended for running and editing this sample.
- [VS Code Azure Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack) extension is recommended for interacting with Azure through VS Code Interface.
- A modern web browser. This sample uses **ES6** conventions and will not run on **Internet Explorer**.
- An **Azure AD** tenant. For more information, see: [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant)
- A user account in your **Azure AD** tenant.

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-nodejs-tutorial.git
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> :warning: To avoid path length limitations on Windows, we recommend cloning into a directory near the root of your drive.

### Step 2: Install project dependencies

Locate the root of the sample folder. Then:

```console
    cd 2-Authorization/1-call-graph/App
    npm install
```

## Registration

There is one project in this sample. To register it, you can:

- follow the steps below for manually register your apps
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  - modify the projects' configuration files.

<details>
   <summary>Expand this section if you want to use this automation:</summary>

> :warning: If you have never used **Microsoft Graph PowerShell** before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts Guide](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.

1. Ensure that you have [PowerShell 7](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.3) or later.
1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. For interactive process -in PowerShell, run:

    ```PowerShell
    cd .\AppCreationScripts\
    .\Configure.ps1 -TenantId "[Optional] - your tenant id" -AzureEnvironmentName "[Optional] - Azure environment, defaults to 'Global'"
    ```

> Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts guide](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md). The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.

> :information_source: This sample can make use of client certificates. You can use **AppCreationScripts** to register an Azure AD application with certificates. See: [How to use certificates instead of client secrets](./README-use-certificate.md)

</details>

### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

### Register the client app (msal-node-webapp)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `msal-node-webapp`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
   - In the **Redirect URI (optional)** section, select **Web** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URI: `http://localhost:4000/redirect`.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Certificates & secrets** blade in the left to open the page where you can generate secrets and upload certificates.
1. In the **Client secrets** section, select **New client secret**:
   - Type a key description (for instance `app secret`),
   - Select one of the available key durations (**6 months**, **12 months** or **Custom**) as per your security posture.
   - The generated key value will be displayed when you select the **Add** button. Copy and save the generated value for use in later steps.
   - You'll need this key later in your code's configuration files. This key value will not be displayed again, and is not retrievable by any other means, so make sure to note it from the Azure portal before navigating to any other screen or blade.
   > :warning: For enhanced security, consider using **certificates** instead of client secrets. See: [How to use certificates instead of secrets](./README-use-certificate.md).
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
   - Select the **Add a permission** button and then:
       - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected.
       - In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, select **Microsoft Graph**
       - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **User.Read** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
       - Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.
   - Select the **Add a permission** button and then:
       - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected.
       - In the list of APIs, select the API `Windows Azure Service Management API`.
       - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **user_impersonation** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
       - Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.

#### Configure the client app (msal-node-webapp) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `App/authConfig.js` file.
1. Find the key `clientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `msal-node-webapp` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `tenantId` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.
1. Find the key `clientSecret` and replace the existing value with the key you saved during the creation of `msal-node-webapp` copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `redirectUri` and replace the existing value with the Redirect URI for `msal-node-webapp`. (by default `http://localhost:4000/redirect`).

> :information_source: For `redirectUri`, you can simply enter the path component of the URI instead of the full URI. For example, instead of `http://localhost:4000/redirect`, you can simply enter `/redirect`. This may come in handy in deployment scenarios.

1. Open the `App/app.js` file.
1. Find the string `ENTER_YOUR_SECRET_HERE` and replace it with a secret that will be used when encrypting your app's session using the [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) package.

## Running the sample

Locate the root of the sample folder. Then:

```console
