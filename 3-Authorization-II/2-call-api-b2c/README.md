## Overview

This sample demonstrates a Node.js & Express web application calling a Node.js & Express web API protected by Azure AD B2C using the [Microsoft Authentication Library for Node.js](https://aka.ms/msalnode) (MSAL Node). In doing so, it also illustrates various authorization concepts, such as [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow), [Dynamic Scopes and Incremental Consent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent), [Access Token validation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tokens-overview#validation) and more.

## Scenario

1. The client application uses the **MSAL Node** to sign-in a user and obtain a JWT **Access Token** from **Azure AD B2C**.
1. The **Access Token** is used as a *bearer* token to authorize the user to access the **resource** (a Node.js & Express custom web API).
1. The **resource owner** responds with the resource that the user has access to.

- A user account in your **Azure AD B2C** tenant.

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-nodejs-tutorial.git
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> :warning: To avoid path length limitations on Windows, we recommend cloning into a directory near the root of your drive.

### Step 2: Install project dependencies

Locate the root of the sample folder. Then:

```console
    cd WebAPI
    npm install
    cd ../
    cd WebApp
    npm install
```

### Register the sample application(s) with your Azure Active Directory tenant

:warning: This sample comes with a pre-registered application for testing purposes. If you would like to use your own **Azure AD B2C** tenant and application, follow the steps below to register and configure the application in the **Azure portal**. Otherwise, continue with the steps for [Running the sample](#running-the-sample).

### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD B2C tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD B2C tenant.

### Create User Flows and Custom Policies

Please refer to: [Tutorial: Create user flows in Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-user-flows)

### Add External Identity Providers

Please refer to: [Tutorial: Add identity providers to your applications in Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-add-identity-providers)

### Register the service app

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD B2C** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `ExpressWebApi-c3s2`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Certificates & secrets** blade in the left to open the page where we can generate secrets and upload certificates.
1. In the **Client secrets** section, select **New client secret**:
   - Type a key description (for instance `app secret`),
   - Select one of the available key durations (**In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**) as per your security posture.
   - The generated key value will be displayed when you select the **Add** button. Copy the generated value for use in the steps later.
   - You'll need this key later in your code's configuration files. This key value will not be displayed again, and is not retrievable by any other means, so make sure to note it from the Azure portal before navigating to any other screen or blade.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Expose an API** blade to the left to open the page where you can declare the parameters to expose this app as an Api for which client applications can obtain [access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) for.
The first thing that we need to do is to declare the unique [resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) URI that the clients will be using to obtain access tokens for this Api. To declare an resource URI, follow the following steps:
   - Select `Set` next to the **Application ID URI** to generate a URI that is unique for this app.
   - For this sample, accept the proposed Application ID URI (api://{clientId}) by selecting **Save**.
1. All Apis have to publish a minimum of one [scope](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#request-an-authorization-code) for the client's to obtain an access token successfully. To publish a scope, follow the following steps:
   - Select **Add a scope** button open the **Add a scope** screen and Enter the values as indicated below:
        - For **Scope name**, use `access_as_user`.
        - Select **Admins and users** options for **Who can consent?**
        - For **Admin consent display name** type `Access ExpressWebApi-c3s2`
        - For **Admin consent description** type `Allows the app to access ExpressWebApi-c3s2 as the signed-in user.`
        - For **User consent display name** type `Access ExpressWebApi-c3s2`
        - For **User consent description** type `Allow the application to access ExpressWebApi-c3s2 on your behalf.`
        - Keep **State** as **Enabled**
        - Select the **Add scope** button on the bottom to save this scope.

#### Configure the service app to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `WebAPI\auth.json` file.
1. Find the key `clientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `ExpressWebApi-c3s1` application copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `tenantId` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.
1. Find the key `clientSecret` and replace the existing value with the key you saved during the creation of the `ExpressWebApi-c3s1` app, in the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `policies.authorities` abd replace it with the authority strings of your policies/user-flows, e.g. `https://fabrikamb2c.b2clogin.com/fabrikamb2c.onmicrosoft.com/b2c_1_susi`.
1. Find the key `policies.authorityDomain` abd replace it with the domain of your authority, e.g. `fabrikamb2c.b2clogin.com`.

The rest of the **key-value** pairs are for routes that you would like to require authorization. They are set as **default**, but you can modify them as you wish:

```json
        "protected": [
            {
               "route": "/<route-to-require-access-token-access>",
               "scopes": [ "<scope-required-for-access>" ]
            }
        ]
```

### Register the client app

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD B2C** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `ExpressWebApp-c3s2`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
   - In the **Redirect URI (optional)** section, select **Web** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URI: `http://localhost:4000/redirect`.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Certificates & secrets** blade in the left to open the page where we can generate secrets and upload certificates.
1. In the **Client secrets** section, select **New client secret**:
   - Type a key description (for instance `app secret`),
   - Select one of the available key durations (**In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**) as per your security posture.
   - The generated key value will be displayed when you select the **Add** button. Copy the generated value for use in the steps later.
   - You'll need this key later in your code's configuration files. This key value will not be displayed again, and is not retrievable by any other means, so make sure to note it from the Azure portal before navigating to any other screen or blade.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
   - Select the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **My APIs** tab is selected.
   - In the list of APIs, select the API `ExpressWebApi-c3s2`.

1. Find the key `clientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `ExpressWebApp-c3s1` application copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `tenantId` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.
1. Find the key `clientSecret` and replace the existing value with the key you saved during the creation of the `ExpressWebApp-c3s1` app, in the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `redirectUri` and replace the existing value with the Redirect URI for ExpressWebApp-c3s1 app. For example, `http://localhost:4000/`.
1. Find the key `postLogoutRedirectUri` and replace the existing value with the base address of the ExpressWebApp-c3s1 project (by default `http://localhost:4000/`).
1. Find the key `policies.authorities` abd replace it with the authority strings of your policies/user-flows, e.g. `https://fabrikamb2c.b2clogin.com/fabrikamb2c.onmicrosoft.com/b2c_1_susi`.
1. Find the key `policies.authorityDomain` abd replace it with the domain of your authority, e.g. `fabrikamb2c.b2clogin.com`.

The rest of the **key-value** pairs are for resources/APIs that you would like to call. They are set as **default**, but you can modify them as you wish:

```json
        "nameOfYourResource": {
            "callingPageRoute": "/<route_where_this_resource_will_be_called_from>",
            "endpoint": "<uri_coordinates_of_the_resource>",
