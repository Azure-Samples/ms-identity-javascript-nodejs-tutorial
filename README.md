# Tutorial: Enable your Node.js web app to sign-in users and call APIs with the Microsoft identity platform

The [Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-overview), along with [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) (Azure AD) and [Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview) (Azure AD B2C) are central to the **Azure** cloud ecosystem. This tutorial aims to take you through the fundamentals of modern authentication with Node.js, using the [Microsoft Authentication Library for Node.js](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js) (MSAL Node).

This tutorial also features a simple wrapper around **MSAL Node** [ConfidentialClientApplication](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-node/src/client/ConfidentialClientApplication.ts) class in order to streamline routine authentication tasks such as login, logout, token acquisition, as well as utility methods to validate tokens and etc. You can find the wrapper here: [msal-express-wrapper](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/msal-express-wrapper). Fork it and customize as you need. Suggestions and contributions are welcome!

We recommend following the chapters in successive order. However, the code samples are self-contained, so feel free to pick samples by topics that you may need at the moment.

> :warning: This is a *work in progress*. Come back frequently to discover more samples.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (>= v12.x)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) (>= v4.x)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [VS Code Azure Tools Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack)
